# Cat Gallery App

A simple yet elegant Android application that showcases a gallery of cats fetched from "The Cat API". This app demonstrates the use of Jetpack Compose for building modern Android UIs. It's designed as a single-screen application displaying a vertical list of cat images, offering a smooth and responsive user experience.
